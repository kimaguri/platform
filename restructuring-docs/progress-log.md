## ðŸŽ‰ ARCHITECTURE RESTRUCTURING COMPLETED!

All 8 tasks have been successfully completed. The Encore.ts multi-tenant platform has been fully restructured with:

- âœ… **Zonal Organization**: Shared utilities organized by function
- âœ… **Connector System**: Adapter pattern for database abstraction
- âœ… **Service Restructuring**: 4 focused microservices
- âœ… **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and monitoring
- âœ… **Configuration Management**: Type-safe, centralized configuration
- âœ… **Root Configuration**: Updated all configuration files

The platform is now ready for development with the new architecture!
